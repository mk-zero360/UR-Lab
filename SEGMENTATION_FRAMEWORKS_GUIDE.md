# GfK Roper Consumer Styles & Sinus Milieus Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to implement **GfK Roper Consumer Styles** and **Sinus Milieus** as predefined user segments in your user research application. These are two of the most established consumer segmentation frameworks used globally and in Germany respectively.

## Framework Descriptions

### GfK Roper Consumer Styles

The GfK Roper Consumer Styles is a global segmentation model that categorizes consumers into **8 distinct segments** based on fundamental values, attitudes, and technological affinity. This framework is particularly useful for international markets and cross-cultural consumer research.

#### The 8 GfK Roper Consumer Styles Segments:

1. **Alphas** - Traditional and ambitious leaders
2. **Rooted** - Thrifty, media-heavy consumers
3. **Trend Surfers** - Health-conscious, socially active

8. **Homebodies** - Security-oriented, material comfort focused

### Sinus Milieus

The Sinus Milieus model, developed by the German SINUS Institute, groups people with similar values, lifestyles, and social situations into "like-minded" segments. It's structured along two axes: **social status** (education, income, occupation) and **value orientation** (traditional to postmodern).

#### The 10 German Sinus Milieus Segments:

1. **Conservative Establishment** - Upper-class traditional milieu
2. **Liberal Intellectual Milieu** - Highly educated progressives
3. **Performer Milieu** - Success-oriented efficiency experts
4. **Expeditive Milieu** - Young, pragmatic, globally connected
5. **Adaptive Pragmatist Milieu** - Modern mainstream, work-life balance
6. **Socio-ecological Milieu** - Environmentally and socially conscious
7. **Traditional Milieu** - Lower-class traditional, security-oriented
8. **Precarious Milieu** - Struggling for social participation
9. **Hedonistic Milieu** - Young, fun-oriented, immediate gratification
10. **Digital Cosmopolitan Milieu** - Highly connected, globally oriented

## Implementation in Your Application

### Files Created

I've created four CSV files for you:

1. **`gfk_roper_consumer_styles.csv`** - Complete GfK Roper Consumer Styles framework (8 segments)
2. **`sinus_milieus_germany.csv`** - Complete German Sinus Milieus framework (10 segments)
3. **`zero360_user_segments.csv`** - Complete zero360 User Segments framework (25 segments)
4. **`predefined_segments_example.csv`** - Updated with sample segments from all three frameworks

### How to Use in the Streamlit Application

#### Step 1: Upload Predefined Segments

1. In your Streamlit app, navigate to **Step 1: Define Target Demographics**
2. Look for the "ðŸ“Š Bulk Data Import" section
3. Use the file uploader to upload one of the CSV files:
   - `gfk_roper_consumer_styles.csv` for global consumer styles
   - `sinus_milieus_germany.csv` for German market focus
   - `zero360_user_segments.csv` for comprehensive German consumer segments
   - `predefined_segments_example.csv` for mixed segments from all frameworks

#### Step 2: Select and Use Segments

1. After uploading, you'll see "Available Predefined Segments"
2. Use the dropdown to select a specific segment
3. Preview the segment details in the expandable section
4. Click "ðŸŽ¯ Use '[Segment Name]' Segment" to apply it
5. The system will automatically generate personas for that segment

#### Step 3: Generate User Research

The selected segment will be used as the basis for:
- **Persona Generation**: Creates detailed user personas matching the segment characteristics

- Adding location-specific details

### Creating Hybrid Segments
Combine characteristics from multiple segments:
```csv
segment_name,segment_description,age_range,income_level,location,tech_comfort,lifestyle,key_motivations,persona_count
Eco-Tech Alphas,"Ambitious leaders who combine traditional success values with environmental consciousness",35-55,High income,Urban areas,High,"Achievement-oriented but environmentally conscious, values both status and sustainability","Achievement, Environmental responsibility, Status, Innovation",3
```

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-Segment Research
1. Upload your chosen framework CSV
2. Run separate research sessions for different segments
3. Compare results across segments using the analytics features
4. Identify cross-segment patterns and unique segment characteristics

### Segment Validation
Use the generated personas to validate your segment assumptions:
- Do the personas align with your expectations?
- Are the motivations realistic for your product/service?
- Do the interview responses feel authentic?

### Market Sizing
Combine segment data with market research:
- Use segment characteristics to estimate market size
- Apply demographic filters to understand segment prevalence
- Validate segment relevance in your specific market

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CSV Upload Fails**
   - Ensure CSV uses UTF-8 encoding
   - Check that all required columns are present
   - Verify no empty rows or invalid characters

2. **Segments Don't Load**
   - Check the CSV format matches the template
   - Ensure `segment_name` column has no empty values
   - Verify `persona_count` contains valid numbers

3. **Generated Personas Seem Off**
   - Review and adjust the `key_motivations` field
   - Modify the `segment_description` for more specific guidance
   - Ensure `lifestyle` field provides sufficient detail

### Support

For additional support with implementing these frameworks:
1. Review the example CSV files for proper formatting
2. Check the Streamlit app logs for specific error messages
3. Validate your CSV data against the template structure
